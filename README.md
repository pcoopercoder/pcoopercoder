## About

I am a year-round Research & Development Intern with the Machine Intelligence and Visualization Group at Sandia National Laboratories and an M.S. student in the Computational Language Understanding Lab at the University of Arizona. My research interests lie at the intersection of model robustness, security, and transparency with a focus on building NLP systems resilient to adversarial attacks. I have led studies investigating Unicode perturbation detection, text normalization, AI-optimized case selection for content moderation, and malicious text-to-image prompt mitigation. My work reflects a deep-rooted enthusiasm for creating safer, more trustworthy AI systems.
