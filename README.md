## About

I have led studies involving online hate speech detection, AI-optimized case selection to support ethical content moderation, and adversarial text-to-image prompt mitigation. My research was published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, and I was recently selected as a 2024 Goldwater Scholar.
